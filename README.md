#Customer Segmentation Analysis Readme*

*Overview:*

This repository contains a customer segmentation analysis focusing on understanding customer behavior. The analysis utilizes K-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to group customers based on their characteristics and uncover insights into their behavior.

*Folder Structure:*

- *data:* Contains the datasets used for the analysis.
- *notebooks:* Includes Jupyter notebooks containing code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and customer segmentation using K-means and PCA.
- *results:* Contains visualizations, tables, and other outputs generated during the analysis.

*Data:*

The dataset comprises customer data, including demographic and transactional attributes. Detailed information about the dataset and its variables can be found in the data folder.

*Analysis Steps:*

1. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*
   - Explore and visualize the data to understand variable distributions, identify patterns, and detect outliers or missing values.

2. *Data Preprocessing:*
   - Preprocess the data, handling missing values, scaling numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and any necessary transformations to prepare for clustering.

3. *Customer Segmentation:*
   - Apply K-means clustering to group customers into distinct segments based on their attributes. Determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques such as the elbow method or silhouette score.

4. *Principal Component Analysis (PCA):*
   - Use PCA to reduce the dataset's dimensionality while preserving variance. This aids in visualizing high-dimensional data and identifying significant features contributing to customer segmentation.

*Results:*

The results folder contains visualizations and tables summarizing analysis findings, including cluster profiles, customer segmentation visualizations, and insights into customer behavior.

*Conclusion:*

The customer segmentation analysis offers valuable insights into different customer groups, enabling businesses to tailor marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer experiences to specific segments. Understanding customer behavior and preferences can lead to more targeted and effective business decisions, enhancing customer satisfaction and retention.

*Dependencies:*

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed to run the code:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

*Usage:*

To reproduce the analysis, follow steps outlined in the notebooks located in the notebooks folder. Adjust file paths or configurations as needed based on your environment.
